This is the NineSixty theme (http://drupal.org/project/ninesixty) developed as a Zen sub theme for use with Zen theme (http://drupal.org/project/zen).

This theme is only for Drupal 6

INSTALLATION:

- Download Zen Theme for Drupal 6 version (http://drupal.org/project/zen) and unzip this theme into /sites/all/themes/

- The Zen theme is the based theme that must be installed to have this sub theme work properly

- Now unzip this theme (drupalsverige) and place it in your theme directory, so directory path should look like: /sites/all/themes/drupalsverige

- Login as admin go to Administer --> themes and enable '960 Grid System (Zen sub theme)' theme (/admin/build/themes)

- You can configure the theme settings. To do this click on 'configure' link next to the theme in the theme listing page.

------------------------------------------
What's different in this theme compare to the original NineSixty theme:
------------------------------------------

- It inherits all the theme settings from the Zen theme (ie inline block editing)

- Added Debug mode (showing grid on the page) as a theme setting so you can enable/disable it in the theme settings (/admin/build/themes/settings/drupalsverige) 

- Additional region added: 'content top' and 'content bottom' so blocks can be assigned to the top or bottom of the main content area.
